<p>When you’re miles away from your home, you can’t afford taking even a single day for granted. You’re completely at you own absolutely every time. And, as you understand, life is pretty good at putting you into situations which you definitely don’t want to be in the zone of your experiences. I had a tough time dealing with some such situations.</p>

<h3>A MEDICAL EMERGENCY!</h3>

<p>On a fine Sunday afternoon, I had strolled to a nearby market place to have some food. As usual, I stopped near a MOMO point and ordered for a plate of chicken momo. Meanwhile, I had a <b>sudden feeling of weakness</b>. My body started shivering with a heavy headache and things started getting blurred right in front of my eyes. I just couldn’t figure out, what’s happening to me & was scared enough! Not exaggerating, but at a moment I felt like I may get over with my life that day itself! Anyhow, I packed my food and tried to walk towards my room as it was less than some 300-400 metres away from that shop. </p>

<br>
<p>Within just some 15-20 steps, I almost felt like I might get unconscious. Having an extreme shortage of energy to even put further steps, I literally settled myself for a while on the roadside. After a while,fortunately, I <b>survived</b> with a little energy to get back to my room and have some rest to get completely recovered. </p>
<br>

<h3>RESCUE ME FROM THIS LIFT!</h3>

<p>
The PG, where I used to stay, had its kitchen and aqua guard setup at the top floor of the building which could be publicly accessed by the tenants. So, one late evening, I stepped inside the lift with my roommate to reach there to fill my empty bottles of water. But that’s when the <b>lift had a malfunction</b>! It got shut with a heavy scary noise! Fortunately it didn’t hurt any of us. 
</p>
     
 <div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/internship/25.webp" alt="">  
                                   <p>Photo by Gaurav Baya on <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></p>                                      
                                  </div>

<p>The <b>safety button</b> on the lift turned out to be the life saver, as it alerted the supervisor to arrive at the earliest possible notice. Soon to realise, a major issue with the machine which may not be in the arena of his expertise to fix. Somehow, due to existing sense of intelligence, he turned off the electric supply to the lift, and brought his master key to open the lock of the doors. After a series of repeated failures attempts, finally we could see the light of freedom!</p>
<br>
<p>Although, it might seem a very small incident of life. But, it makes me respect the value of <b>extending support for the people in need</b> around us. What would have happened, if the supervisor hadn’t rose into the situations and rescued us, l had no idea how much hours I'd have spent inside being locked for no reason!</p>

<br>
<h3>REFUND MY MONEY!</h3>
<p>The major <b>financial blow</b> came in the first week itself, when I was way too desperate to find a PG for myself. I was like not in a mood to extend my stay in the hotel any more or delay my joining in the office. And, this is where I committed a serious mistake, financial one this time! </p>

<br>
<p>The OYOLIFE follows an <b>age old payment system</b>, where they manually generate the payment link and send you to proceed ahead! I mean, like who does that in the 21st century, when everything is just automatic! Anyway, after finalizing my first PG, I was instructed by the customer support of OYO to proceed with the payment link, they had just sent me out. And, without any further delay I completed the procedure and had a sigh of relief to have an address for next two months.</p>

 <div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/internship/24.webp" alt="">  
                                   <p>Photo by Josh Appel on <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></p>                                      
                                  </div>

<p>
But, here is where the blow came in! Soon I was instructed by the customer support to <b>make the payment again</b> with the new link as the earlier link stands expired and leaving me clueless regarding exactly when I’d get my refund! I’ve made the payment twice due to my ignorance without having any clarity about getting one of them reversed to my account. It literally took me to <b>write them multiple mails, calls and requests</b> to get this money refunded nearly after a month. This was the time, when I was almost at the verge of meeting a financial disaster.</p> 
<br>
<p>
Somehow the stipend of the first month got credited in that week and I survived again! Because, when you’re miles away from your home, every buck matters!The important lesson for me here is to never mislead or trouble the customer, because history is full of such examples where <b>giant business houses have collapsed when they had started taking their customers for granted!</b> 
</p>

<br>
<h3>THE GREAT(!) INDIAN POST TRAGEDY</h3>
<p><i>If you’ve any friend or relative in Gurgaon and you feel like sending anything through speed post, then better refrain from it and try out some other courier services, otherwise it may not reach her ever in your whole life time!</i> </p>
<br>
<p>
I had witnessed the <b>epitome of unprofessionalism</b> when a friends of mine had sent me a letter via speed post service in my office address which is located in the Sector 65. Since the day she sent me the letter, I had kept a keen eye on the tracking of the consignment to ensure that, I didn’t miss it out at any cost. The tentative date, when the tracking status displayed <b>OUT FOR DELIVERY</b>, I was at my place waiting till the later evening for the letter to get delivered, but it never happened! Much to my surprise the status now displayed as <b>DELIVERED</b>! I couldn’t figure out, how this could even happen! With a hope to receive it the next day, I left for home. But, it didn’t work out then also and all of my queries with the security personnel and the office reception yield no values in my favour, as they had no entry of postman in those two days. </p>


 <div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/internship/23.webp" alt="">  
                                   <p>Photo by Bundo Kim on <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></p>                                      
                                  </div>
<p>
On the third day, with a deep anger inside, I reached the <b>Badshahpur Post Office (Gurgaon)</b>, where my letter had got stuck. I started explaining my issue to them by showing them the tracking status on my mobile and requested them to deliver my parcel. But believe me, their reaction was extremely disheartening. They appeared like a bunch of illiterate and mentally retarded fellows, deployed by the government in the public service. They weren’t in a mood to accept, there could even be any fault by their end! But, I wasn’t interested to lose this battle. After having a serious <b>war of words</b> with them, finally they had to put their arrogance down and handed over the letter to me which my friend had written with a sense of dignity.
This made me realise, how important it’s in life to <b> speak up and fight for your interests</b>, otherwise it won’t take much time for the world to take you for granted and put you aside. Just be aware of that! 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Well! The interesting part is, <b>I had never ever revealed my family about any of the misfortunes</b> I had encountered during my stay until I had safely reached my home. Probably, life is like that! You can’t be a pampered kid all throughout your life or they can’t be like everywhere to safeguard you from unprecedented threats. You & only you’ve to take charge of your life and get the things done.
