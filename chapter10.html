<h3>JULY 17, 2019</h3>
<p>Finally that day arrived, for which I have been waiting for since a long time! To get back to my home, meet my family and friends whom I’ve not met in last two months. I had got done with my packing from the last night and wasn’t in a mood to get delayed for the flight which was scheduled at 11 AM.</p>

<br>
<p>
Like any other day, I woke up and got prepared for the exit! Just <b>one final time</b>. I won’t have to go to the office anymore or get stuck in the pollution of the city. Somewhere, in the midst of the heaviness of emotions, I hugged my roommate, submitted him the keys of the room and booked my cab for the nearest metro station Huda City Centre to reverse the journey till the airport which had made me arrived here. I had only gratitude looking back at those countless faces who some way or the other have served me during my stay. </p>
<br>

<p>
After travelling for almost an hour, finally I reached at the place where my journey had began… <b>INDIRA GANDHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NEW DELHI</b>. The Indigo flight 6E 2019 was all set to provide a comfortable journey to its customers like me waiting at the airport to board for Bhubaneswar! </p>



<h3>WHY ARE YOU SO HEAVY!</h3><p>
 The boarding pass enabled me an access through the security check at the entry point of the departure of the domestic terminal. With a little steps ahead, I printed my boarding pass and waited in the queue of Indigo baggage drop point to submit my luggage. </p>
<br>
<p>
 Very soon, when my turn came, I was very politely informed by a staff,<i> <b>"Mr. Sourav! You’re exceeding the weight limit by 4 KG and you’ve to pay a fine of ₹1,600/-."</b></i> I had no idea, my bag had put on this much of weight in just last two months! Being clueless, I asked him, whether they accept Phonepe or PayTM. But, he seemed to be trained to collect cash only. He indicated me towards an ATM nearby, where I rushed without any delay as if my life depended upon it. Fortunately, I had it in my account and I got access through the security checks after making the payment.</p>

                                    </div>

<h3>ARE YOU SURE, IT’LL TAKE ME TO BHUBANESWAR!</h3>
<p>
This awkward experience of paying an extra sum had melted away my joy of booking the ticket at a cheaper price. Somehow, a little portion of my heart seemed to be vanished just to find my flight destined for KOLKATA according to the display board in this silent airport, where no boarding announcement is made. Although a basic search of my <b>PNR status</b> on my smartphone turned out to be in my favour, still I wasn’t fully convinced. I felt as if, I’ve got stuck in between. I couldn’t even move back, as I’ve dropped my baggage at the counter and I can’t even fly to Kolkata! </p>

<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/internship/40.webp" alt="">

                                    </div>
<p>
Without any further delay, I reached out to the Indigo officials present nearby to learn this flight’s regular schedule to Kolkata from Delhi, while that day it had an exception for which it was destined for my hometown Bhubaneswar. With a little bit of hope I waited till the time of boarding, when my tensions disappeared to find many Odia speaking folks around me waiting in the queue just like me to catch the flight. Finally, the Indigo bus dropped us near the flight and after a little waiting period, the pilot got into action and we left the land of Delhi! </b>
</p>

<h3>The TAKE OFF!</h3>

<p>
That picturesque of the final view of the city while the flight took off would never fade away of my memories. After nearly 1hr 45 Min, the pilot announced of a good weather in Bhubaneswar and of just being 150 KM away from the city. Believe me, within just 10 mins we had landed! The moment finally came when the wheels of the flight ceased at the runway & my eyes got flashed on the board displaying <b>BIJU PATNAIK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, BHUBANESWAR</b>. I was safely back home, rather with some positive transformations as a human being! 
</p>


<h3>FINAL WORDS, BEFORE I STOP… </h3>
<p>
Sometimes I wonder, whatever I had experienced within just 57 days, were these just a dream or even a reality! I try to recall those countless faces who had picked me on the cabs, served me food and helped me at the time of need. I hadn’t planned any of those things. I had just thought of my simple job as an intern, but <b>life paid me thousands time better than I could have ever thought.</b>  
</p>
<br>
<p>Travelling indeed expands the horizon of your personality and lets you embrace people irrespective of the societal classifications. And, I believe, it’s just the beginning. I won’t be stopping anytime soon. This trip made me realised of the incredible possibilities of human life. And I’m no more interested in settling into an average life being caught up in the rat race. That’s for sure. Just a brief life, why to waste it in pretending like someone!</p>

                                    </div>
<p>In fact, now <b>I’m no more the same person in many ways!</b> You just leave some portions of your heart with the new places you trade into, which enlightens the soul within! It’s the love and care of others which made this happen for me. The stipend I had received was just a compliment, but the experiences would enrich me for the years to come!</p>
<br>
<p><b>Signing off!</b></p>
<br>
<p>With Love,</p>
<p>Sourav</p>
