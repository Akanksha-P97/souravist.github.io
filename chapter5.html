<p>I was a bit scared before shifting to Gurgaon for its <b>rising crime rates</b> reflected in the media. But believe me, the love that I’ve received from the locality is beyond the scope of my intellects to explain. The very moment I arrived in this city, I had developed an ardent desire to <b>get socialised with absolutely everyone</b> I’d come across, be it the waiter in the restaurant, the cab driver, the people in my office or the tenants in my PG. They had turned an extended family for me, where I was open to new faces everyday. The cherry over the cake was my roommate Sachin bhaiyaa, who turned out to be a helping hand at the time of need all throughout the stay. The late night outings or the mid night food delivery by Zomato were some of the best memories which I had collected during this period.</p>

                                   <p>The <b> Late Night Outings</b> in the City</p>                                      
                                  </div>

<h3>THE TECHNOLOGY HUB</h3>
<p>This iconic city of Haryana, which hosts the offices of Google and Microsoft, has a rich culture of technology, especially in IT sectors. Every second or third person you meet on the street or in a dhaba, would have a higher probability of being a developer or tester in any grooming startup or MNC with a lofty package. For a person with strong competence getting fired isn’t an issue here, as another company on the opposite side of the road would be waiting for him to welcome into their cubicle. Due to diverse culture of office, <b>Gurgaon appears like a mini India</b> to me, where people from all walks of life come to test upon their destiny and try out things.</p>
<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/internship/19.webp" alt="">
                                   <p>The <b>Sector 55-56 Rapid Metro Station</b> in Gurgaon</p>                                      
                                  </div>

<h3>ADDICTION TO ALCOHOLISM</h3>
<p><b>Even success does come with a price tag</b>. The glamour of IT invites an array of stress and anxieties. The people with less control over their impulses and wisdom of self-control, quite easily fall prey to drug addiction, around which they develop their very own <b>laughable logics</b> to justify their actions. This could be reflected in the public culture of the city, where smoking breaks are allowed in the office hours and bars and pubs remain overcrowded even on the week days. The people have got adapted to these in order to digest the reality of life. </p>
<br>
<p>
Somewhere, I understand this as the downside of the fake masks, the successful people have put on their faces. They're well equipped with the life styles which is indeed the dream of half a billion in this country, but in the evening when I find them struggling with their own issues and try to resolve that with any sorts of alcoholism, <b>I never get impressed with these big white elephants</b> with seemingly impossible command over the communication skills. Because, the true essence of a city doesn’t lie in the multiple skyscrapers or malls it has, but the soft <b>culture</b> it has developed in the lives of the people it hosts.
</p>

            
<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/internship/20.webp" alt="">
                                   <p>The <b>Sector 29 Market Place</b> With the Bars & Pubs</p>                                      
                                  </div>
<p>I <b>won’t go</b> into the <b>moral sides of alcoholism</b>, whether it should be practised or not. But, in a financial hub like this city, which grabs the attention of clients all across the world, if the people aren’t very well inside and struggling for survival even being at the top of the organizational hierarchy, then they are <b>literally of no use</b> in the all-round growth of this nation. At least, the rapidly increasing footsteps in the pubs makes this much of sense to my naked eyes!</p>

<h3>A FIGHT AGAINST THE EXPENSES!</h3>
<p>
The <b>expensive lifestyle</b> of Gurgaon had encouraged me to keep a track of each and every expenses on my smartphone on a daily basis to make sure, I didn’t get bankrupt like half of the people in city due to their inability to manage the finances. This standard practice gave me the exposure to realise the priorities and wipe out irrelevant stuffs from the life to lead a financially balanced life. I’ve kept this practice on going even today although I’m back to college now. The key take away lesson out of this would be something like:</p>
