<p><b>THE END gives a meaning to the life</b>. Something in life becomes unduly important when you realise it’s not forever and it’s just for few moments. Then you start respecting the time you’ve in hand and try out everything possible to have a memorable end to the journey. And, that’s what makes the human life, a divine beauty!</p>

<h3>JULY 15, 2019</h3>
<p>
The offer letter had clear mention of 15 JULY as the final serving day for me in the office. The day before it was a Sunday and had seen the nerve trickling, yet the arguable victory by England in the Cricket world cup. With a sympathy for the losing team New Zealand, I stepped outside my room to meet my responsibilities as the intern for one last time. </p>

<br>
<p>

To make the day memorable, I had got a <b>Letter of Gratitude</b> for the company and the designed <b>portrait</b> along with me, which I offered at the end of that day. This was a quick emotional moment for me to see everyone having a smile looking at this and querying about the thoughts involved with it. I believed, some way or the other, this was needed to unite my teammates (Shashank, Akanksha & Ankita) who had walked the journey with me. Finally, I was asked to put it at a place of my choice inside the cabin. I believed, it would some way or the other enrich the cultures of EnrichAI in coming years, where I had spent precious two months of my life.</p>

<p>
 Wait! <b>The climax isn’t here!</b> My office duration got extended for one more day, where I was invited for a small farewell party! Somehow, I was still in the college in that time and always been a part of the events to bid farewell to my seniors, but till then I hadn’t been offered so!
</p>


<h3>JULY 16, 2019</h3>
<p>
I had kept this day as reserve to get sorted with everything else before I fly back to my city the very next day. As, I had no more boundaries of duty to reach in time, waking up early was never a choice any more for that day! Somehow, I made my <b>final trip to the office</b>, where they had ordered some of my favourite dishes in the lunch. After we all had got done with it, I was offered a set of cool goodies to take back home and to offer my friends with whom we had served together.</p>
<br>
<p>
I believe, it’s quite important in our lives, to leave the places in a little better way than we had received it! Don’t you think so? That’s been the source of my inspiration all throughout the life. As we can’t take anything at the end of this life, then why don’t we transform ourselves and <b>let everybody have a great time in our presence!</b>
</p>

<p>
This had turned an extended family in those two months. Without any hesitations, lemme admit this as a wonderful journey collaborating with the in-house team in the office. Coming alone to this city and going back with a bag full of the tremendous love and support received from the people over here won’t ever fade away out of my memories.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The soothing vibes in the office has taught me to love and <b>genuinely care for the people around</b>. We had joined this work with literally nothing with us to boast of and we were stepping down
with a crave for knowledge and an inherent desire to make some tangible contributions to the
lives around with the tools of technology.
