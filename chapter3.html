<h3>JUNE 12, 2019</h3>                                   

<p>A sudden collapse of the joy came on this morning, when I was getting ready for my office like any regular day. Much to our surprise, a <b>local goon</b> sent by the landlord arrived from nowhere with a verbal notice for every tenant to <b>vacate the property</b> as it had undergone some disputes with the <a href="https://www.oyolife.in/" target="_blank">OYOLIFE</a> who had taken it in lease. </p>
<br>
<p>I was like shocked for a moment. My roommate had already left for his office. I couldn’t decide, what should be my further steps. <b> Where could I find a home now?</b> Or Did I even have the window till the evening to attend my office and get sorted with this? But, I can’t even trust this arrogant rowdy shouting at my doorstep. What would happen, if they break into my room and throw away my belongings and it’d be too late for me to take any action? I couldn’t think of going back my home that night or even can’t afford shifting to a new PG all of a sudden, as the living cost stays at its peak in a city like Gurgaon. </p>

Fortunately, the legal team of OYOLIFE came into our defence in a short span of time and handled the matter for the moment, which gave us the space to have a sigh of relief and get back to work. In the evening, we were shifted to one of the nearby OYO properties in the locality, as that property was no more a safe abode for the tenants. </p>              
<br>

 
<h3>RESIST THE TEMPERATURE, IF YOU CAN!</h3>
<p>As I was on a short stay of two months only, so the shifting wasn’t much of a hassle for me as I had very minimum luggage of my own. The extra space in this new room casted a ray hope to spend the rest of my time in the city without any more issues. Meanwhile, the air conditioner of the room had a break down. We tried to adjust in the unsettling heat of the city, till the time Oyolife assistant arrive to get the AC fixed. But, the <b> pathetic customer service</b> left us in that condition for next three days. In fact, they never came to check the issues although extending fake promises over the helpline number.</p>
<br>

<h3>JUNE 15, 2019</h3>
<p>
We gave a thought to shift to another PG in a day or two, as we were permitted by OYOLIFE to shift anywhere within the month as we had paid the rent and the mistake was at their end for evacuating us without any notice. So, without any more delays, we took the benefit of the scheme into our favour and got shifted to a suitable property in a different locality. </p>
<br>
<p>
Just imagine, it was the <b>fifth place</b> (wo hotels & three PGs) I had stayed in Gurgaon in just the duration of 2 months of internship!
<b><i>
 How much more flavours of life I could ask for!! </b></i> FINALLY! This was the place from which I was fortunately not thrown out till the end! The key take away lesson out of this would be like:
