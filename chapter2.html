<h3>MAY 25, 2019</h3>                                   

<p>With an equal blend of nervousness and excitations, I stepped inside the office of <a href="https://enrichai.com" target="_blank">EnrichAI</a> where my reporting officer and CEO of the company Mr. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arijit-biswas-86507119/" target="_blank">Arijit Biswas</a> greeted me with a jovial smile and provided me the access card to get smoothly through the security hassles of the property. Soon, I was briefed about my responsibilities and got introduced to other colleagues. When I walked amongst a bunch of geeks busy with their terminal screens with some serious debugging efforts, it didn’t take me long to <b> find myself as the only NON-TECHNICAL GUY</b> in that technical setup! From the first day I realised, I’ve many tough lessons to learn through the journey not just to survive, but also to thrive in my time as an intern.</p>

<p>
As we had already started working on this project, two weeks before coming to the office, so the tasks weren’t completely alien for me. Also, as we had hold several phone and video calls in that period, the in-house team had turned familiar for me to work along with. I was the <b> most junior fellow</b> in the office with everyone around me, much ahead in experience and age. I’d sometime seem like a school returned kid! Somehow, I had trained myself to get uplifted to the standards of the professional world in order to go hand in hand with others. </p>              
<br>

<p>The office arrangement was such that, you’d mostly feel like being seated inside a cafeteria or a restaurant. In addition to that, the high speed wifi, free coffee and some really humble colleagues were like the cherry over the cake!<i> <b>What more could I ask for in such a distant place from my home!</i> </b>The peaceful environment was intrinsic and intuitive enough to let the minds focus on innovation. Later on, even on some weekend days, I used to stay a bit longer in the office after everyone has left just to ensure I didn’t miss out these <b>creative vibes</b>. I’d just put on ear phone with a track full of songs of various genres and stick to my job without any interruption.</p>

<h3>HAPPY HOURS PARTY</h3>
<p>
 Sooner I became aware of this day as something special, as we had the </b>HAPPY HOURS PARTY</b> in the office. Like on some selected Saturdays, after the working hours, the staffs unwind themselves on the terrace over some sumptuous food items & drinks. </p>

                                  </div>
                                  <!-- Post Image End -->
                                  <p>
The <b>open end discussions</b> on life, career, relationships etc amongst the staffs in the party gave me the scope to know my colleagues in a little better manner, alongside with whom I had to serve in the coming ways. I had got immersed in the discussion like such that, I couldn’t move out till 9 PM in the night! Soon to realise, the next day as Sunday and I had to reach my PG in time, I booked my cab and made the journey back home.
