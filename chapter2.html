<h3>MAY 22, 2019</h3>                                   
<p>I woke up in the midnight itself to catch my early morning flight at 5 AM from Bhubaneswar to Delhi. Apart from my excitations and countless expectations, I was quite nervous deep inside before this first flying experience. I had taken enough instructions regarding all the procedures from one of my friends who have vast travel experience. I had mentally rehearsed his instructions a thousand times prior to that! </p>

<br>
                                                 
<p>After a quick shower and a simple dressing nearly at 4.00 AM we left for the airport and reached there in some 10-15 minutes at max as you don’t get any traffic in the early morning hours! I was accompanied by my family & made sure nobody gets emotional as I left, rather they should let me go on with a joyful manner. And After moving through baggage drop and security checks finally I received the call for boarding. It took me a whole lot of struggle to figure out the adaptability of the safety belt until a kind gentleman sitting beside me extended his support.</p>

<br>              
<p>After a flight hour of nearly 1 Hr 50 Mins, the pilot announced of a clear weather in Delhi & getting ready for the most challenging part “the LANDING”. My time on the land of capital city of India began the very moment when the Indigo Flight 6E 2489 landed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport at 7.15 AM in the morning. The very moment when the wheels touched the ground, I could feel it being seated and took a sigh of relief for being alive! Having the privilege to fly for the first time wasn’t less than a life changing experience! Above all, the architectural beauty of Delhi airport deserves a standing ovation! Without any more delays, I rushed to the conveyor belt & grabbed my trolley bag and moved towards the exit gate to lead myself towards Gurgaon!</p>

<h3>The Landing</h3>              
<p>After a flight hour of nearly 1 Hr 50 Mins, the pilot announced of a clear weather in Delhi & getting ready for the most challenging part “the LANDING”. My time on the land of capital city of India began the very moment when the Indigo Flight 6E 2489 landed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport at 7.15 AM in the morning. The very moment when the wheels touched the ground, I could feel it being seated and took a sigh of relief for being alive! Having the privilege to fly for the first time wasn’t less than a life changing experience! Above all, the architectural beauty of Delhi airport deserves a standing ovation! Without any more delays, I rushed to the conveyor belt & grabbed my trolley bag and moved towards the exit gate to lead myself towards Gurgaon!</p>  

<br>              
<p>I opted to take the route of Delhi Metro towards my destination in Gurgaon to get a flavour of this highly acclaimed public transport system. This year this metro service is celebrating its silver jubilee (1995-2019) & I felt honoured to have arrived in a time like that. My journey starting from airport metro station moved towards New Delhi metro station. There I needed to change my train & travel towards Huda City Centre metro station on yellow line, which is the final station at Gurgaon. Metro is supposed to be the cheapest and fastest way of travel inside a city, which I’ve ever experienced! </p>

<br>              

<h3>Towards My Destination: Gurgaon! </h3>   
<p>It was a bit challenging to travel for nearly an hour in a standing position with the laptop bag on my back and trolley bag near my feet. As, I had boarded the train on the peak morning hour when millions of Delhites take metro to reach their work stations. I was surprised to find people solving MCQs and going vividly through the newspaper “THE HINDU” in this busiest route of metro as a part of their preparation for UPSC exam, while I was struggling to grab a seat!

<p>
After an hour nearly at 9.30 AM, I deboarded at Huda City Centre. So, I’m finally I had reached at Gurgaon, my temporary address for the next two months! Just in last 4 - 4.5 hours, I’ve travelled approximately 1900 KM, I hardly could believe that! After some light snacks, an Ola auto dropped me at my hotel location where I was supposed to stay for two nights before shifting to a PG nearby, which was present in a remote area of the city. I was a bit alone deep inside and sceptical enough even to go on a strolling to nearby places. I was badly missing my home, my family and my friends! 
</p>
<br>  
<h3>Twist In The Plot</h3>        
            
<p>
I had an initial talk with a nearby PG before coming here where I was supposed to shift from the hotel I was staying in next two days. But, the unexpected moment came, when the PG supervisor denied access to me mentioning no availability of room. I was literally at a state of shock to find another PG at an affordable cost within the next two day, or I might get homeless in this city. I had never imagined, survival could even be an issue ever in my life! I definitely can’t afford check-in to a hotel for entire two months! I would literally say it in HINDI:</p>
                       

<br>                            
<p>At the end of two days, I booked another nearby hotel for just one night to find a PG somewhere in the city just to make sure I possess a stable physical address during my stay. Thankfully, I managed to find a room provided by Oyolife in a busy area with an affordable price of ₹4.5K, which neither covers the food nor the electricity! Electricity costs very high in Gurgaon which is at ₹10/unit. As the rooms were equipped with Air Conditions, you can’t even think of any financial savings! Somehow, in the early morning of 25th May finally I shifted to my room with the luggage and collected the keys from the supervisor and prepared to step inside my office as an intern in that same day. </p>


<br>
<p>Here’s the priceless lesson I’ve captured from this really uncomfortable experience of life:
