<p>I was almost settled into the startup culture and the pretending life style of the city where success is gauged on the basis of the scale of the <b>noisy life style</b> you maintain to envy others. Some way or the other, I had started turning one of those in no time. I used to be the guy who never stops cracking humour even at the extreme stressful situations. </p>
<br>
<p>
But, under the pressure of financial management and handling the burdens as a professional, some way or the other I had donned the <b>mask of fake lifestyle</b> and lost the charm of my existence somewhere in the crowd. I had already developed a notion that, things would any way go fine, even if I don’t put much efforts. I was much interested into the glamour of the city, rather than enhancing the inner beauty of my own self. </p>

<p>I had got lazy enough to produce any work which would bring that <b>Wow factor</b> to the table even in the office or in my personal space of life. I was literally struggling to make a design or even write a page, which were used to be cakewalks for me few weeks back.  I had kind of almost lost my spark!</p>
<br>
<p>
 These things started hampering my contributions as a teammate, where I got surprised to see a clear decline in my works over a period of time. Believe me, this is the mental trauma everyone goes into when they start taking themselves too seriously and underestimate the importance of learning and regular practice. I was <b>no more experiencing the joy</b> at my job and was at the verge of failure. Somewhere, I felt this needs to be stopped, otherwise I’d be vanished in no time.</p>

<br>
<h3>EVEN THE DARKEST NIGHT HAS ITS SUN RISE!</h3>
<p>the chain of frustrations had a break, when I took the bold decision to complete a <b>conceptual portrait</b> covering our efforts as a team and present it to EnrichAI with a deep sense of gratitude for their contributions in the growth of our lives. This decision came just few days prior to my exit from the town.  I had no window for any sorts of procrastination and was determined enough to uplift myself this time. And finally, the deadline weaved the magic for me! I got done with my digital painting without much delay, which revived the lost confidence within me.</p>

<p>

<p>
It made me realise that, even a fraction of <b>action outperforms tall talks</b> with no execution in the background. This is where I had my rebirth as a professional!
