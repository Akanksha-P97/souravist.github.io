I take it a privilege to share with you a snippet of my walk through the designs. It has been nearly two years
since I had got fascinated by the aesthetics, colors, lines, shapes and the infinite possibilities they could weave
together. I’d keep it very simple, as I’m just a learner like you and not an expert at all by any means. All I could
share is just my story and perception towards the things. Please don’t see this as any exhaustive guideline,
rather take inspirations from it and write your own story.
<br><br>
It all started from Quora, where I got mesmerized with the minimalist designs carried out by one of the user
Named Sahil Dev. You may have a look through his answers. After having a glance through his works,
somewhere deep inside I realized, how would it look, if I give it a try! Prior to that, I had very little experience
with Photoshop back in school days where my job was limited to a very basic level of functionalities.
<br><br>
Well! For the first time I got introduced to a new tool titled “ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR”. After using that, I’ve never
looked back! Just out of curiosity, I threw myself the challenge on the date December 10, 2017 to work
consistently for next 100 days on making new designs absolutely every day without a single pause irrespective
of whether it’s a Sunday or my exam day! Just to keep a track of my growth, I used to send them to my friends
and take their suggestions for improvements. Believe me, nothing has helped me to grow more than this!
<br><br>
To be precise, on the 62nd Day I got selected for an internship in a startup based in Haryana for designing
posters and banners for their websites, promotions and newspaper printings. I continued it for one month
according to the agreement and then the term got extended for more five months.
<br><br>
Fast forwarding the story, I had the privilege to design the t-shirts for AAVAHAN 2019 & INOVOATE 3.0 which
were fortunate enough to be accepted by the SUIIT community. Later on, I ended up with an in-office
internship last summer in a Gurgaon based start-up, where I had worked on the frontend development of a
major ongoing project.
<br><br>
With experiences, you would understand the field of designs is not about aesthetics or colors only. Rather it’s a
tool to address human problems and give voices where words fail! So, pick this tool with a sincere devotion
and you’d be surprised to see the wonders it can do. Meanwhile, before you try out anything in-depth, have an
humble beginning with the below resources:
 Creativebloq | Behance | Pinterest : Look These for inspirations
 Youtube: Take free tutorials, understand basics and take your imaginations into action
