<h3>JANUARY 7, 2019</h3>                                   
<p>This day and the timeless memories associated with it would be cherished by us for the years to come. A group of 40 students, 4 teachers, an instructor from ISRO and the bus driver to assist us, witnessed the historic moments of the visit by the <b>first ever group from Odisha</b> to arrive at this highly secure satellite launching site.</p>

<br>


<p>Visiting one of the ISRO centres on the <b> Golden Jubilee Year </b> (1969-2019) is not less than a dream
came true moment for most of us. Even many of us neither had such higher dreams ever! Sometimes it
seems like, with the mask of ISRO, the nature chose us to give us an exposure to something much larger
than our current set of strengths and standards to make us move towards contributing for a better
future of this nation.  </p>
<br>

<h3>SULLURUPETA: THE GATEWAY TO SRIHARIKOTA!</h3>   
<p>The journey started with a bus trip from the <b> Sullurupeta railway station </b> to <b> Sriharikota island</b>. Security checking at every minimum distance was the first impression of this place that got registered in our
minds. Aadhaar card and college ID along with formal attires had literally turned lifelines for us in that
particular day. With a bit refreshment at the Aryabhatta guest house present inside the campus
followed by the breakfast, we got ready to explore the Space research centre along with the instructor.
</p>

<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/posts/ISRO (4).webp" alt="">
                                   <p><b>Sullurupeta Railway Station </b>| Clicked By <a href="https://instagram.com/souravist" target="_blank">Sourav Kumar Sahoo</a></p>                                      
                                  </div>

                        
<br> 


<p>The presence of this centre over an island on the Bay of Bengal with the Pullicat lake nearby makes it a
lucrative spot for the travellers. Along with that, the beauty lies inside the campus which is purely
enriched with green lush of flora glorifying the Space Mission of India. Probably, that’s why the nearby
town <b> Sullurupeta</b> boasts itself for serving as the <b>Gateway to Sriharikota</b>, the path to India’s Space
Odyssey!</p> 
<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/posts/ISRO (1).webp" alt="">
                                   <p><b>Main Entrance<b> of<a href="http://www.shar.gov.in/" target="_blank"> SDSC-SHAR</a></p>                                      
                                  </div>
              

<p>It involves a whole lots of tough processes to have the permission granted from the ISRO authority to traverse through the SDSC-SHAR. Due to its nature of carrying out secret missions
throughout the year, they can’t afford the interference of trespassers in their pursuit of social welfare.So only through having a strong network with any ISRO insiders, access can be granted to this ultrasecure
zone.</p>           



<br>
<p>
In spite of all the careful efforts, we were running one hour late from the schedule which was supposed
to be 9.30 AM. But, somehow by 10.40 AM we managed to be inside an auditorium to watch some
introductory videos on SDSC-SHAR to recall the contributions of great minds like <b> Dr. Vikram Sarabhai </b>
who’s widely regarded as the Father of Indian Space Programme and <b> Prof. Satish Dhawan </b> after whom
this centre is named, before stepping into the ground zero to understand the activities carried out in the
space missions. Prior to that, we had to leave our smart gadgets and other belongings behind and had to
move on with an ID card a diary in our hands.</p>

<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/posts/ISRO (3).webp" alt="">
                                   <p><b>The Architectural Beauty of Sriharikota</b>| Clicked by <a href="https://instagram.com/souravist" target="_blank">Sourav Kumar Sahoo</a></p>                                      
                                  </div>
<h3>MISSION CONTROL CENTRE</h3>

<p>Then we headed to the <b>Mission Control Centre</b> popularly called as  MCC. The circular structured
centre, inaugurated back in 2012 by then Hon’ble President of India Smt. Pratibha Patil, hosts some large
display screens to showcase real time satellite data and a set of computers with chairs meant to be
occupied by the top level scientists during the launching days and a VVIP audience gallery behind which
had hosted the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India in the past. We were standing somewhere between the
both. Ashok Kumar Meher, serving as the technical officer at ISRO, was constantly guiding us throughout the visit by explaining us each and every single thing we come
across and putting his meticulous efforts to quench the thirst of the curious questions in our minds.</p>
<br>

<p>I personally got captivated with the name plates displaying <b>Mission Director</b> & <b>Vehicle Director</b> present over two of the monitors inside the centre. These two persons are ideally referred as the
ultimate bosses of a space mission. During the <b>T-15 Mins</b> (15 Mins. Prior to the launch), if there occurs
any criticalities with the rocket, only these two guys can take the call whether to go for the launch or
make it delayed. Probably it would be the dreams of many young aspiring Indians to get seated someday
inside the Mission Control Centre and we were fortunate enough to spend nearly half an hour there!<i>
What more beautiful things we could expect than this one in our engineering career!</i></p>

<br>
<h3>LAUNCHPADS</h3>
<p>Then the bus took us near the <b> Launchpad I</b>. As a rocket was under the development stage on the day of
our visit, we were allowed to observe it from a distant place. This one is regarded as the oldest and the
most reliable Launchpad of ISRO which has India’s successful <b>Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)</b> launched
back in Nov 2013 to its credit along with numerous successful missions. Just standing at that place and
observing the assembling process of the rockets was a quite fulfilling personal experience for me. I was
overwhelmed with the patriotism from top to bottom along with an urge to dedicate rest of my life for the
nation. I’ve got all the highest sense of respect for those countless unsung heroes who pull the socks
and work round the clock in the service of the nation.</p>





<br>

<p>Followed by this, <b>Launchpad II</b> turned out to be our next destination. Although having seen the videos of
several launches from here on the television screens prior to the visit, I literally got blown away to see
the majestic structure installed by the ISRO. The nearly 80M tall building known as umbilical tower is
used for fuelling & launching of the rocket after getting assembled at a building present exactly 1 KM
away from that place. The structure is much larger and dynamic than it appears on the photographs.
One must visit here once to perceive this fact. </p>
<br>

<p>This Launchpad is credited with the successful launch of
India’s Moon Mission <b>Chandrayan II</b> in 2019 along with many more other successful launches. As
there was no space mission under progress, on the day of our visit, we had the scope to move to an
extreme closer area of the launchpad which certainly gets unmanned in the launching days.<i> We could
clearly boast of once being at that place, where lies the path to break through the limitations of sky and
get into the space! The memories of this still gives me goosebumps!</i></p>


<br>
<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/posts/ISRO (7).webp" alt="">
                                   <p>The Technical Setup inside the campus of <a href="https://www.shar.gov.in" target="_blank">SDSC-SHAR</a></p>                                      
                                  </div>
<p>The rest of the journey includes the observation of the powerful <b>antennas</b> installed to capture
satellite data, checking a scalable model of the rocket and spending few minutes in the <b>space museum</b>
singing the glittering past of this premier space agency. The trip got concluded with a meal in the
canteen and few clicks at the main gate of SDSC-SHAR where photography is permitted. Meanwhile I
had ensured every details of this tour get entered into my diary for the reference in future. In addition to
that, I had politely <b> collected the autographs of every single person on this trip </b>  including the instructor
from ISRO to freeze these moments for the years to come. <i>Probably, a billion dollar couldn’t even
exchange the experience that ISRO has given us in that one single day!</i> If life permits, I’d not hesitate
ever to be in that place again!</p>


<div class="post-image margin-top-40 margin-bottom-40">
                                   <img src="images/posts/ISRO (8).webp" alt="">
                                   <p>The Students of SUIIT At Space Museum of <a href="https://www.shar.gov.in" target="_blank">SDSC-SHAR</a></p>                                      
                                  </div>
<p>In the end, I’d like to sum up with a sense of satisfaction deep inside for being in that place which had
seen the footfalls of legendary scientists in the past who had dedicated their whole lives for the
beautiful days we are enjoying today. Without any doubt, all the credits go to ISRO officials and the SUIIT
authority for making this trip turn into a reality. <i> Trips would also happen to us in the future, but the
adventurous experience like this one would reverberate in our ears for the years to come!</i></p>
